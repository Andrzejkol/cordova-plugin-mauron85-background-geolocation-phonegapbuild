cordova-plugin-mauron85-background-geolocation-phonegapbuild
==============================

# Deprecated
This plugin is not needed anymore as Adobe® PhoneGap™ Build already has support for frameworks like google play.

Instead use of [cordova-plugin-mauron85-background-geolocation](https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation) is recommended and should work fine with PhoneGap™ Build.
